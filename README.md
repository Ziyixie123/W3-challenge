## Summary 
This script used the conditional and loop methods to generate lists/ dictionaries for county options, candidate options, votes of each candidate, and votes for each county. In the end, we also collect the candidates and county who gets the most votes court. With modification, such as changing the name of the list and changing conditions, this script can perform data analysis for any voting involved dataset. For example, this script can analyze the best-seller books in the bookstores, the best TV shows on Netflix, and the best cars sold in the last year.
